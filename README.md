### DepoRes

This is a hobby project which should provide a useful interface for the sport fans which want to see better statistics for their favourite teams or players.

The backend part is written in Python with FastAPI and PostgreSQL as a storage.


Currently, it's mostly a project structure than a real project.
So far I'm trying to implement the functionality of adding the neccesary data.
In the POC I want to use an `Admin` panel for adding the info about the sport activities. On the later stage it can be done automatically.
